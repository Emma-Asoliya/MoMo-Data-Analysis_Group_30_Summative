*Momo Data Analysis*

Introduction:
This application processes SMS data in XML format, cleans and categorizes the data, and stores it in a relational database. We have built an interactive and user-friendly dashboard using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to analyze and visualize the data effectively.

Features:
Data Categorization: Categorizes transactions into categories like Incoming Money, Transfers, Fees, Purchases, and more in XML format.
Data Cleaning: Extracts key info like date, transaction ID, amount and etc in JSON format
SQL Database: Stores categorised and cleaned  data in a structured MySQL database for retrieving for the front-end
Frontend Dashboard: Interactive, responsive dashboard that visualizes the data and allows users to view their data 

What did we use?:
For the front-end we used HTML,CSS and Javascript
For the back-end we used Python and MySQL

How to install?

How do i use the dashboard:
If it gives you an option on whatever transaction category you need a break down on for example Airtime purchases, Cash power purchases, Bank deposists and so on. After selecting what category you want, it then shows you the total messages received from that category and the total amount spent. You can also select withinspecific dates i.e If i want to see my transactions from a particular category within 06/06/2024 to 20/06/2024 all i have to do is input those dates in the provided boxed and it will show me all the transactions performed within those dates, alongside the total messages and the total amount.
